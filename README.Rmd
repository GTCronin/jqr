R interface to jq http://stedolan.github.io/jq/

To install, after cloning the repo the first time, run (from the command line)

```
./bootstrap.R
```

which will download the 1.4 release of [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/).  This does not need to be run on subsequent runs, and will stop being required once [this issue](https://github.com/ropensci/jqr/issues/1) is resolved.

```{r}
library("jqr")
```

## Interfaces

### low level

There's a low level interface in which you can execute `jq` code just as you would on the command line:

```{r}
str <- '[{
    "foo": 1,
    "bar": 2
  },
  {
    "foo": 3,
    "bar": 4
  },
  {
    "foo": 5,
    "bar": 6
}]'
```

```{r}
jq_(str, ".[]")
```

```{r}
jq_(str, "[.[] | {name: .foo} | keys]")
```

### high level 

The other is higher level, and uses a suite of functions to construct queries. Queries are constucted, then excuted with the function `jq()`. 

Examples:

Index

```{r}
x <- '[{"message": "hello", "name": "jenn"}, {"message": "world", "name": "beth"}]'
x %>% index() %>% jq
```

Sort

```{r}
'[8,3,null,6]' %>% sort %>% jq
```

reverse order

```{r}
'[1,2,3,4]' %>%  reverse %>% jq
```
