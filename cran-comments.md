I have read and agree to the the CRAN policies at
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.4 and
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and WinBuilder.

This is a new package.

Note that CHECK says that 'jq' should be sentence cased, but that is
an improper spelling of the software.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
